## Business Context

### Coperniq's Unique Value
- **ONLY** brand-agnostic monitoring platform for microinverters + batteries + generators
- Solves the "3+ platform chaos" problem for multi-brand contractors

### Target Market
- **Resimercial** contractors (both residential + commercial)
- **Multi-OEM certified** (2-3+ brands = highest pain point)
- **SREC states** (sustainable markets post-ITC)

### Key Insights
- **Multi-OEM contractors** (2-3+ brands) are 10x more valuable than single-brand
- **SREC states** have sustainable incentives after federal ITC expires
- **ITC urgency** creates natural closing pressure (residential Dec 2025, commercial Q2 2026)

## ICP Scoring Dimensions

1. **Resimercial (35%)** - Both residential + commercial = scaling contractors
2. **Multi-OEM (25%)** - Managing 2-3+ platforms = core pain point
3. **MEP+R (25%)** - Multi-trade self-performers = platform power users
4. **O&M (15%)** - Operations & maintenance = recurring revenue focus

**Tier Thresholds:**
- üíé **PLATINUM** (80-100): Immediate executive outreach
- ü•á **GOLD** (60-79): Priority BDR outreach
- ü•à **SILVER** (40-59): Nurture campaigns
- ü•â **BRONZE** (<40): Long-term pipeline
