**Status**: COMPLETE

**Launch Command**:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_monitor.py
```

**Features**:
- ⚡ Real-time progress tracking (all 3 OEMs)
- 📊 Performance charts (dealers collected, progress %)
- 📜 Live activity logs (last 30 lines per OEM)
- 🔄 Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
- 🎨 Professional UI with Plotly charts

**For Portfolio/Interviews**:
- Shows full-stack capability (backend + frontend)
- Demonstrates real-time monitoring skills
- Proves understanding of user experience
- Great for live demos during interviews

### 3. Terminal Recording Setup ⏳
**What to Capture**:

**Option A: Manual Screenshots** (easiest):
```bash
# 1. Take screenshots of Briggs running (in progress now)
# 2. Take screenshots when Generac starts
# 3. Capture final completion screens
```

**Option B: asciinema Recording** (professional):
```bash
# Install asciinema
brew install asciinema

# When Generac starts, record:
asciinema rec output/generac_recording.cast

# Run Generac scraper
python3 scripts/run_generac_national.py

# Stop recording: Ctrl+D

# Convert to animated GIF (for README)
asciicast2gif output/generac_recording.cast output/generac_demo.gif
```

**Option C: Screen Recording** (most impressive):
```bash
# Use macOS screen recording (Cmd+Shift+5)
# Record terminal window while Generac runs
# Export as MP4 → convert to GIF for GitHub
```
