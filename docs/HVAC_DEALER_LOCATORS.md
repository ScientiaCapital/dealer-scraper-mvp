## Why These 4 HVAC Brands Matter for Coperniq ICP

### MEP Capability Detection
- **HVAC presence = Mechanical trade capability**
- Cross-referencing HVAC + Solar + Generator = true MEP+R contractor
- Commercial HVAC (esp. VRF) = resimercial validation

### Commercial Signal Strength
| Brand | Commercial Indicator | Strength |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| Carrier | Factory Authorized (commercial + resi) | Medium |
| Trane | Comfort Specialist (commercial + resi) | Medium-High |
| Lennox | Premier Dealer (commercial available) | Medium |
| **Mitsubishi** | **Diamond Commercial (VRF)** | **VERY HIGH** üèÜ |

### Target Contractor Profile
**Ideal Coperniq ICP with HVAC data:**
- Generator (Generac/Briggs/Cummins) + Solar (Enphase/Tesla/SMA) + **HVAC (Mitsubishi Diamond Commercial VRF)**
- Score breakdown:
  - Multi-product (40 pts): Gen + Solar + HVAC = 40 pts
  - Multi-OEM depth (30 pts): 4-5+ OEMs = 30 pts
  - Tier quality (20 pts): Diamond Commercial + Premier/Platinum = 20 pts
  - Market (10 pts): SREC states = 10 pts
  - **Total: 100/100 ICP score** üéØ

## Implementation Priority

1. **Mitsubishi Diamond Commercial** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - VRF contractors = clear commercial signal
   - Smallest dataset (most selective tier) = fastest to scrape
   - Highest ICP value per lead

2. **Lennox Premier Dealers**
   - Similar tier structure to Generac (Premier = top tier)
   - Good mix of commercial + residential
   - Proven dealer locator pattern

3. **Trane Comfort Specialists**
   - Large national network
   - Multiple tier badges to track
   - Strong commercial presence

4. **Carrier Factory Authorized**
   - Largest HVAC brand by market share
   - Broad dealer network
   - Good baseline HVAC capability signal

## Next Steps

1. Inspect each dealer locator URL with Playwright to understand DOM structure
2. Write extraction scripts (similar to Generac/Briggs/Cummins pattern)
3. Test on 3 ZIPs per brand
4. Add to multi-OEM scraping workflow
5. Run national scrape (140 SREC state ZIPs √ó 4 HVAC brands = 560 scrapes, ~45-60 min total)

## Expected Dataset Sizes (Estimated)

- **Mitsubishi Diamond Commercial**: 50-150 contractors (highly selective VRF tier)
- **Lennox Premier**: 300-600 dealers
- **Trane Comfort Specialist**: 800-1,500 dealers
- **Carrier Factory Authorized**: 1,000-2,000 dealers
