# üöÄ QUICKSTART - Get Coperniq Leads TODAY

**5-minute setup to generate scored contractor leads for SREC states**

---

## Prerequisites

‚úÖ Python 3.8+  
‚úÖ RunPod account (for automated cloud scraping)  
‚úÖ 10 minutes

---

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd dealer-scraper-mvp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 2: Add Your RunPod API Key

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Get your RunPod credentials:
   - Go to https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
   - Copy your **API Key**
   - Copy your **Endpoint ID** (from the deployed playwright-api endpoint)

3. Edit `.env` and add your credentials:
   ```bash
   RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID=your_actual_endpoint_id_here
   ```

---

## Step 3: Generate Leads (MVP - Generac Only)

Run the lead generation script for California:

```bash
python scripts/generate_leads.py --mode runpod --states CA --limit-zips 5
```

**What this does:**
1. ‚úÖ Scrapes 5 California ZIPs for Generac dealers via RunPod cloud API
2. ‚úÖ Filters to SREC states only
3. ‚úÖ Scores with Coperniq algorithm (multi-OEM, SREC priority, commercial capability, geography, ITC urgency)
4. ‚úÖ Exports CSV sorted by score (HIGH priority first)

**Output:**
- `output/coperniq_leads_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` ‚Üê **START HERE** (scored, sorted)
- `output/coperniq_leads_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` (full data)
- `output/generac_dealers_raw_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` (unscored raw data)

---

## Step 4: Call Your Leads!

Open the CSV in Excel/Google Sheets:

```
priority_tier | total_score | contractor_name | phone | ...
HIGH          | 85          | ACME ELECTRIC   | (555) 555-5555
HIGH          | 82          | XYZ CONTRACTORS | (555) 555-1234
MEDIUM        | 65          | ...
```

**Prioritization:**
- **HIGH (80-100)**: Call first - multi-brand contractors in prime SREC states
- **MEDIUM (50-79)**: Call second - solid prospects
- **LOW (<50)**: Call last or skip

---

## Full Production Run (All SREC States)

Once you've tested with CA, run all 6 SREC states:

```bash
python scripts/generate_leads.py --mode runpod --states CA TX PA MA NJ FL
```

**Scrapes ~70-90 ZIPs across:**
- California (SGIP + NEM 3.0)
- Texas (deregulated market + ERCOT)
- Pennsylvania (PA SREC)
- Massachusetts (SREC II + SMART)
- New Jersey (NJ TREC)
- Florida (net metering + tax exemptions)

**Estimated time:** ~10-15 minutes  
**Estimated cost:** ~$0.50 (RunPod serverless)

---

## Scoring Breakdown

Each lead gets 0-100 score across 5 dimensions:

| Dimension | Max Points | What It Means |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Multi-OEM Presence** | 40 | 3+ OEMs = 40pts (desperately need unified platform)<br>2 OEMs = 25pts (strong prospect)<br>1 OEM = 10pts (lower priority) |
| **SREC State Priority** | 20 | HIGH state = 20pts (sustainable post-ITC)<br>MEDIUM state = 10pts |
| **Commercial Capability** | 20 | 50+ employees = 20pts<br>10-50 = 15pts<br>5-10 = 10pts<br><5 = 5pts |
| **Geographic Value** | 10 | Top 10 wealthy ZIPs = 10pts<br>Top 30 wealthy ZIPs = 7pts |
| **ITC Urgency** | 10 | CRITICAL (commercial Q2 2026) = 10pts<br>HIGH (residential Dec 2025) = 7pts |

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

Once you have RunPod working, you can add:

### 1. **Multi-OEM Detection** (Identifies contractors in 2-3 OEM networks)
   - Add Tesla Powerwall scraper extraction logic
   - Add Enphase installer scraper extraction logic
   - Re-run to find contractors certified across multiple brands
   - **Value:** Multi-brand contractors NEED Coperniq (managing 3 platforms is painful)

### 2. **Apollo Enrichment** (Get employee count, revenue, LinkedIn)
   - Add `APOLLO_API_KEY` to `.env`
   - Improves commercial capability scoring (20 points)
   - Adds contact discovery for outreach

### 3. **Close CRM Import** (Automated lead import + Smart Views)
   - Add `CLOSE_API_KEY` to `.env`
   - Auto-creates segmented Smart Views by:
     - OEM presence (3+ OEMs, 2 OEMs, 1 OEM)
     - SREC state (CA, TX, PA, MA, NJ, FL)
     - Priority tier (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

### 4. **Clay Automation** (Advanced enrichment workflows)
   - Add `CLAY_WEBHOOK_URL` to `.env`
   - Build custom enrichment waterfall

### 5. **Outreach Automation** (10x BDR goal)
   - Email sequences (SendGrid/Mailgun)
   - SMS campaigns (Twilio)
   - AI agent testing (future)

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing RunPod credentials"
- Make sure you copied `.env.example` to `.env`
- Verify `RUNPOD_API_KEY` and `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID` are set
- Check no extra spaces or quotes around values

### "RunPod API timeout"
- Your endpoint might be scaling up from 0 workers (first request takes ~30s)
- Retry - subsequent requests will be faster

### "Empty results"
- Check RunPod logs: https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
- Verify your endpoint is deployed and active
- Test with `--limit-zips 1` first

### "No module named 'scrapers'"
- Run from project root: `cd dealer-scraper-mvp`
- Verify you installed requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
